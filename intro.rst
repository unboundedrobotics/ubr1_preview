Preview Overview
================

Introduction
------------
This documentation covers how to use the UBR-1 Simulator Preview. The simulator
preview includes a simulated UBR-1 in Gazebo, as well as applications like
navigation, manipulation, and some basic perception.

Warnings
--------
This documentation, and the accompanying repository, are only a preview of the
robot. The meshes contained within the ubr1_description package are not final
and will change during the final release, based on tuning for both size and
appearance.

The preview is only tested with ROS Hydro and Gazebo 1.9. A ROS Indigo and Gazebo
2.0 version will be released in the second half of 2014 when the UBR-1 begins
shipping.
